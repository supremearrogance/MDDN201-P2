        <p>151Cuba was provoked by Kashmir Hill and Surya Mattu’s Article, “The House That Spied On Me”. The article specifies how Smart Homes are the new way for Companies to target Household users through data information sent from Internet Service Providers (ISP). This motive to receive financial gain from unethical sources drove 151Cuba  to force everyday Internet users to understand the risks associated with sharing private information online and how much ISP’s can actually see from the data shown on your devices.

        <p>151Cuba was also inspired by Aram Bartholl’s ‘DeadDrops’ project which allows members of the public to connect to wall-fixed USB and share files offline. The public intervention aspect of this installation inspired the frameworks for 151Cuba and supported the need for public awareness regarding this issue.

        <p>As the project is considered a Public Intervention, the location needs to contain high foot traffic to gain public exposure and make the project actually work. According to <a href = "https://wellington.govt.nz/~/media/services/environment-and-waste/urban-development/files/gehl05d.pdf?la=en">Wellington City Council</a>, the Golden Mile (Lambton Quay, Willis Street and Manners Street), the Waterfront near Te Papa and Cuba Streets have the greatest amount of foot traffic in the Wellington Region.
          <br></br>However, the site chosen for this project is 151 Cuba Street. The location is ideal for this project as the location can be used as the name for the Modem, which makes the Modem seem normal to users  who are trying to find open networks. The location also has a large wall near the roadside which allows the data from the users to be projected and shown publicly. </p>
